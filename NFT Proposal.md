## Phase 1 Project Planning and Documentation
During this phase:
- Structuring and creating the board to keep you updated with the development process.
- General research on the different tools I'll be needing and getting any extra software I might need.
- Creating initial files and storing them on a GitHub repository.


**Timeframe**: _4 days_

## Phase 2 NFT minting project
This project will be focused mainly on the creating of an ERC721 smart contract.
This stage requires the most attention since mistakes can be expensive. 
The creation of a front page for the NFT drop will also be handled on this period.

> _If the clients provide references for the UI design of the drop page (should be simple but cool), the process might be faster since I dont have to take time for the design. (2-3 days)_

**Characteristics of the Drop page:**
- Single Page Application that will connect to the ethereum blockchain using popular libraries like web3.js or ethers.js to talk to our smart contract
- Page will connect with MetaMask for authentication
- Users will be able to mint their NFTs.
- Each NFT will be generated in the spot and its characteristics will be stored in the blockchain.
- Each NFT will be randomly generated based on the 5 attributes each token has. (Attributes to be determined).
- For the front end, Next.js and React will be used.
- A domain will be added.

**Characteristics of the smart contract:**
- Have the maximum capacity to store 7,777 unique tokens.
- Each token will have 5 different attributes that will make them unique in looks.
- Each token will have categories that will make them better than the other one.
- The rarer the token, the more expensive and more rewarding it is.
- Smart contract should transfer 3% of every transaction made on other platforms to the company's wallet address.
- An additional 3% per transaction will be transferred to a community wallet.
- Written in Solidity
- Smart contract must be tested with code to ensure  we are free of bugs.


> (MISSING) Attributes on which the NFT look will depend on.

> (MISSING) Characteristics and rewards per category.
>
**_Estimate time:_** 30-40 days

**_Price:_** $22,000

## Phase 3 Booking web app
During this phase, the main booking web application will be created.

**Characteristics of the web app**
- Must be able to take bookings for the different types of rooms.
- Must be compatible with Metamask.
- Offer respective rewards and discounts according to which NFT they own.
- Will require multiple payment methods (credit cards - crypto)
- A place where NFT holders can vote the future use of the collected money in the community wallet.
- If they don't own any NFTs they will need to create a regular account.
  - This implies the use of a system to keep track of who orders.
> _If the clients provide references for the UI design of the booking app (should be throroughly designed), the process might be faster since I dont have to take time for the design. (6-8 days)_

> (MISSING) Information regarding which category has access to which room.

**_Estimate time:_** 2-4 months

**_Price:_** $15,000

## Pricing:
The first two phases (Project Planning and Documentation and NFT minting site for the NFT drop) will have to go hand in hand in order to make it to the deadline

**_Estimate time:_** 30-40 days

**_Price:_** $22,000

---
The last phase (Booking web app) will take its fair share of time since we will be joining both worlds into a hybrid of a web app

**_Estimate time:_** 2-4 months

**_Price:_** $15,000

---
### Total: 37,000

## How can we jump right in?
Given that we will work this on two main phases, 
a down payment of **70%** of the price for the first phase:

_1st payment_ (down payment): 70% of $22,000 = **$15.400**

> This payment will be the signal for me to start working on the project. Phase 1 - 2 will start

_2nd payment_: resting 30% = **$6,600**

> This payment will take place once the Smart contract is completed and tested as well as the drop page.

_3rd payment_: (down payment): 70% of $15,000 = **$10,500**

> This payment will be the signal for me to start working on the project. Phase 3 will start.
> 
> _This phase will also include its own board to keep track of progress_.

_4th payment_: (last payment): 30% of $15,000 = **$4,500**

## Conclusion
I'm extremely passionate about technology and programming. That means that I really enjoy what I do.
You project sounds like an amazing opportunity in the web3 ecosystem, and I'm happy to be a part of it.

Let me know if you have any questions or if I left anything out in the descriptions.
